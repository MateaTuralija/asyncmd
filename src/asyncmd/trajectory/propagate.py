    This class propagates the trajectory using a given MD engine (class) in

    reached and can also concatenate the parts into one trajectory, which then
    starts with the starting configuration and ends with one frame in the state.

    propagate - propagate the trajectory until any state is reached,
                return a list of trajecory segments and the state reached
    cut_and_concatenate - take a list of trajectory segments and form one
