# asyncmd

[![Build Status](https://drone.kotspeicher.de/api/badges/AIMMD/asyncmd/status.svg)](https://drone.kotspeicher.de/AIMMD/asyncmd)

## Synopsis

asyncmd is a library to write **concurrent** code to run and analyze molecular dynamics simulations using pythons **async/await** synthax.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Molecular dynamics simulations are fun and we can learn a lot about the simulated system. Running many molecular dynamics simulations of the same system concurrently is tedious, error-prone and boring but we can learn even more about the simulated system and are more efficient in doing so.
This library addresses the tedious, error-prone and boring part of setting up many similar simulations, but it leaves you with the fun part of understanding the simulated system.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Developers

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like wiki, issue trackers, coding style guide, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## Contributors

You could (and should) give props to all the people who contributed to the code.

## License

GPL v3 (or later)
